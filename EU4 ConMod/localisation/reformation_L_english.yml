 prot.1.t:0 "The Scandanavian Reformation"
 prot.1.d:0 "The issues in Scandanavia were broadly the same as in Germany, with its people in poverty, serfdom, ground down by their religious masters, and not having a Bible in their own tongue. The region overall was beset with struggles between the great families with almost constant shedding of blood. The conditions could hardly be more perfect for a break from the dogma of the traditional Catholic church."
 prot.1.OPTA:0 "The people are right. We must break from the church!"
 prot.1.OPTB:0 "This heresy will pass."
